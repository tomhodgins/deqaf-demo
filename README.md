## About this repository

This is a demo of the [deqaf](https://github.com/tomhodgins/deqaf) CSS parser which reads CSS with instructions for JS-powered rules and outputs JS code required to make it work.

This is a basic element query demo created from one HTML file and one CSS stylesheet that includes JS-powered rules.
